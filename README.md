## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a software development project request by DriverPass, the client. They wanted a system where students and instructors could log in and schedule time for instruction both in the classroom and in car. There was also a requirement for different tiers of service. Some service levels would include online content.

## What did you do particularly well?

I did a good job with action diagrams and describing the program to the client. 

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would work on the use case diagram. I had never created on of these and was not comfortable with it at all.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When designing, the user's needs are the highest priority. The product is for them and if you ignore the user, whatever the reason may be, you'll be the one having a bad experience. Implementing user's needs into the product can be challenging but frequent iterations and close communication is the key to accurately interpreting the user's needs.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Work with the client to determine what a base design should look like. Find out what features would make the product usable then implement these first. Now that there is a base, expand upon that base and add on features. I have learned over time that the initial design will often be clouded with assumptions so getting something in front of the user is important so that it can be built out and improved upon consistently.
